If you input a large number (greater than 12), the factorial will exceed the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer (`MAX_INT`), causing an overflow.\n\n2. **Triggering Overflow:**\n   - For example, if you input `13`, the factorial calculation will result in `13! = 6227020800`, which exceeds the maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer (`2147483647`). This will cause the result to wrap around and become negative or a small positive number.\n\n3. **Check for Negative Result:**\n   - The program does not handle negative results properly, so it may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.\n\n### Example Input:\n```bash\necho \"13\" | ./factorial_frenzy\n```\n\n### Code Solution:\nYou can modify the code to check for overflow before performing the multiplication in the `factorial()` function:\n```c\nif (result > MAX_INT / i) {\n    printf(\"Overflow occurred!\\n\");\n    return -1;\n}\n```\nThis way, you can prevent the overflow and handle it gracefully."

		"description": "You’ve been handed a small utility that asks the user for several words and prints them back in uppercase and reverse order.But there’s a hidden flaw in how it handles memory during input something subtle, but critical.Your task: carefully review the code, identify the memory management issue, and patch it so the program runs safely without causing undefined behavior.Can you spot the fragile piece and make it robust?#include <stdbool.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>#include <string.h>#define MAX_INPUT_SIZE 100/** * Asks the user for a non empty input. * * @param question The question to ask the user. * @return The non empty input. */char *input(char *question) {    char *result = NULL;    int size = 0;    do {        char input[MAX_INPUT_SIZE];        printf(\"%s\", question);        fgets(input, MAX_INPUT_SIZE, stdin);        size = strlen(input);        result = input;    } while (size == 0);    result[size - 1] = '\\0';  // Remove the newline character    return result;}/** * Asks the user for a positive number. * * @param question The question to ask the user. * @return The positive number. */long input_number(char *question) {    long number = 0;    char *last_char = NULL;    char *endptr = NULL;    do {        char *number_string = input(question);        // Convert the string to a long in base 10        number = strtol(number_string, &endptr, 10);        // Get the last character of the string        last_char = &number_string[strlen(number_string)];        // Check if there was no conversion error and if the number is positive    } while (number <= 0 || endptr != last_char);    return number;}/** * Returns the uppercase version of a word. * * @param word The word to convert to uppercase. * @return The uppercase version of the word. */char *uppercase(char *word) {    int size = strlen(word);    char *result = malloc(size + 1);    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {        // Convert the character to uppercase if it is a lowercase letter        if ('a' <= word[i] && word[i] <= 'z') {            result[i] = word[i] - 32;        } else {            result[i] = word[i];        }    }    result[size] = '\\0';    return result;}/** * Asks the user for a number of words and then for each word, prints the * uppercase version of the word in reverse order. */int main(void) {    long number = input_number(\"Enter the number of words to enter: \");    char *words[number];    for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {        char *word = input(\"Enter a word: \");        words[i] = word;        printf(\"You entered %s as word %d\\n\", words[i], i + 1);    }    for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {        char *word = uppercase(words[number - 1 - i]);        printf(\"%s\\n\", word);        free(word);    }    return EXIT_SUCCESS;}",
		"solution": "Solution:\n\nThe issue resides in the fact that the input function returns a pointer to a local variable. To fix the issue, we can either change the input function to return a dynamically allocated string or copy the string into a dynamically allocated buffer before returning it."
